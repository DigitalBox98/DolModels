The bat files will require the below softwares to be installed on your PC : 

- ImageMagick for the image conversion (watermark + border)

These bat files are provided as a semi-manual process : follow each steps described in the corresponding BAT files to make it works


convert-images.bat : image conversion  
==================

Hypothesis is that you put the original images from the NIF models in the "Original" folder
Two kind of images : 
- landscape format = 317x217
- portrait format = 217x317 

import-export-details.bat : items.json file generation

Hypothesis is that you have the original file "objects.csv"
A new file called "items_new.json" will be generated :)
